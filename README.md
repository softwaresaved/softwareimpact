# Showing the impact of software

To encourage more researchers to publish software and reference software in "traditional" papers, we need to show that there is an academic benefit to doing so.

This has been shown to be true for open data - citing open data in your publications increases the research impact profile of those publications (https://peerj.com/articles/175/).

What we need is the reference data sets, tools and ultimately evidence that could show that your papers get more citations, faster, if you mention the software you used in the papers.
